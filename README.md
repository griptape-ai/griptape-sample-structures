# Griptape Samples

This repo contains sample structures for customers to view and use as examples to getting started with both [Griptape](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape) and [Griptape Cloud](https://cloud.griptape.ai/).

## Getting Started

You can deploy and run these samples using Griptape Cloud.

To get started with hosting and running a sample on Griptape Cloud, you will first need to [create Griptape Cloud account](https://auth.cloud.griptape.ai/u/login).

Once logged in, you can connect your GitHub account and [create a structure from a repo](https://cloud.griptape.ai/structures) in Griptape Cloud. You can also click the "Deploy to Griptape Cloud" in each of the sub folders in this repo to get started in 2-clicks with a sample.
