This sample summarizes your website of choice into a text message to a friend. You can toggle seamlessly between two Griptape Agents; one that utilizes [Griptape's Task Memory](https://docs.griptape.ai/latest/griptape-framework/structures/task-memory/) and one that does not. 

To learn more, see the [Griptape blog post on Task Memory and Off-Prompt](https://www.griptape.ai/blog/the-power-of-task-memory-and-off-prompt-tm).

## Running this Sample

### Locally

The prompt this agent runs is: `Summarize the following website into a text message you would send a friend limited to 160 characters: { website }`

You can run this with no parameters and use the defaults. By default, this sample will run with `off_prompt=False` as that is the default for the Griptape Framework. The default webpage that is scraped is the [Off Prompt blog post](https://www.griptape.ai/blog/the-power-of-task-memory-and-off-prompt-tm).

When running this sample, you may specify the `-o` command line option to toggle `off_prompt=True`. You may also specify your own website to summarize with `-w <website-url>`.

```
python structure.py
```

You can specify to run the sample off_prompt with the `-o` parameter
```
python structure.py -o
```

You can change the website that is scraped by specifying the `-w` parameter
```
python structure.py -w https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model
```

### Griptape Cloud

You can create a run via the API or the UI. When creating runs in the UI, you will need to specify parameters on their own lines.

```
-o
-w
